Now we’re talking strategy.

This section can automate growth if used correctly.

🔥 1️⃣ Instagram Auto-Publish

Do NOT connect right now.

Why?

Instagram → Recycled content
Pinterest → Search-based content

Pinterest prefers native vertical optimized pins.

Auto-posting Instagram:
• Usually low reach
• Weak SEO
• Lazy distribution

Skip for now.

🔥 2️⃣ RSS Feed (Very Powerful for You)

This is important.

You have:
vikramchennamsetty.github.io

If you can generate an RSS feed from your site,
Pinterest can auto-create pins every time you publish an article.

That is scalable automation.

Right now:
GitHub Pages doesn’t auto-generate RSS unless you configure it.

If you’re serious about scale:
We set up RSS later.

But not today.

🔥 3️⃣ Upload .csv or .txt (Bulk Pinning)

Very powerful.

You can:
Create 20–50 pins
Upload at once
Schedule them

But do this only after you build:
• 5–10 articles
• Multiple pin variations per article

Bulk without content depth = weak.

🔥 4️⃣ Catalogs / Shopify

Ignore.

You are affiliate content site.
Not direct product seller.

Catalog feature is for ecommerce stores.

🎯 What You Should Do Now

Nothing in this section yet.

Manual growth first.
Automation later.

Current priority stack:

1️⃣ Publish 3–5 strong articles
2️⃣ Create 3–5 pin variations per article
3️⃣ Seed boards with 30 niche-consistent saves
4️⃣ Then automate

You’re building foundation.

Now answer:

Do you want to build Article #2 next
or create 4 more pin variations for Antique Bar Cart first?
