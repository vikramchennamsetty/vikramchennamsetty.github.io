🔥 Rules You MUST Follow

If you don’t follow these, your site becomes a disaster.

Rule 1:

Filename must match link exactly.

Example:

luxury-living-room-ideas.html

Then index must say:

href="luxury-living-room-ideas.html"
Rule 2:

Keep same layout always.

Never redesign per article.
Only change:

• Title
• Description
• Product cards

Rule 3:

Keep consistent naming format.

Use:

7-budget-living-room.html
4-luxury-living-room.html
5-trending-this-month.html

Not random names.

🔥 Pro Upgrade (Optional but Smart)

<!-- ADD NEW ARTICLES ABOVE THIS LINE -->

So every new article goes above that line.

Your newest appears first.

Whenever you want new article:

Duplicate old article file

Rename it
